# Importer of Antenna Pattern from basic MSI files
Nowadays, SIONNA supports default radiation patterns such as: isotropic, short and half-wavelength dipoles, and TR38901 from 3GPP TR 38.901. 
Additionally, it is possible to define customized patterns using callable functions.
This repo contains a jupyter notebook that allows to import radiation patterns from basic .msi files of antenna vendors. 
The imported radiation patterns can be added to sionna as a customized radiation pattern.
